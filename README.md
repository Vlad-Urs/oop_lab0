- For the first 2 tasks I forgot to take screenshots of the installation process for Ubuntu and zsh, therefore I have mostly provided the versions
of the already installed tools.
- after writing the code, and running it with make and gcc the source code was initialized in a local repository, I logged into GitHub,
and created a new repository there, afterwards pushing the code file to the gh repository, all through the terminal as can be seen through the 
screenshots.
